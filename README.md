# Drupal Accessibility Quicksheet

## if you want to know about accessibility in Drupal
- Drupal Core is leveraged by every module & theme on Drupal.org. The central APIs are critical in setting good standard devaults which are inherited by sites built with it. This does not mean that all modules or themes are equally accessible, as individual developers may overlook or turn off best practices that are defined in Core. 
- The Drupal community has been striving for WCAG 2.0 AA since Drupal 7 for both public and administration pages. In Drupal 8 we took on finding ways to incorporate elements of ATAG 2.0 AA, Part A & B. The accessibility team is now looking for ways to address WCAG 2.1 AA recommendations into our code base.
